          This hockey skate came to the Witness Blanket from Muscowequan
          Residential School in Lestock, Saskatchewan. First Nations, Inuit and
          Métis kids in residential school, like kids everywhere, were eager to
          play sports and games. Sports could offer them a break from neglect
          and loneliness. But hockey and other sports were also used to force
          Indigenous children to learn European-Canadian values.<br /><br />
          Leon Wolfe was taken to Muscowequan school. “If you read the stories
          and you hear the stories and you know what the residential school
          experience was about, it was pretty horrific,” he says. “But I guess
          the latter years of going to school to some of these facilities, I had
          a pretty positive experience in sports.”<br /><br />
          Indigenous games and pastimes were almost never allowed at Canada’s
          Indian residential schools. Instead, school staff trained children in
          group exercises and competitive sports such as hockey and skiing.
          Physical education was part of the schools’ colonial mission. But
          sports also offered the kids a chance to work together and develop new
          skills. Children used sports as a survival strategy to endure the
          hardships they faced at residential school.

        Tom Roberts was taken to Prince Albert Residential School in northern
        Saskatchewan. He remembers sneaking away to toboggan: “We used to go
        sliding down the hill here when we weren’t told to, but it was fun.”<br /><br />

        The children used sports to cope. “I joined any kind of sports,” says
        Barbara Johnson. “Name it, I was in it.” Barbara was taken to St.
        Michael’s residential school in Alert Bay, British Columbia. “I just
        loved the sports,” she says. “And I guess the opportunities there were
        what made it softer, made it tamer for us.”<br /><br />

        Eugene Arcand describes himself as “a sports person” and says: “For most
        of us, our saving grace was sports.” He spent 11 years at residential
        schools in Saskatchewan and played as many sports as he could. “These
        sports for me were not sports. They were survival.”<br /><br />

      <h3>
        After the Second World War in Canada, sports – especially hockey – were
        widely seen as an expression of national identity, and not just as fun.
        Accordingly, federal and church authorities used phys ed to educate
        Indigenous children in European-Canadian cultural ideals such as
        discipline and obedience. In 1951, an Indian Agent said: “A rink at this
        school is almost as essential as a classroom.”<br /><br />

        Funding for sports programs was irregular and inconsistent. But if a
        school had a rink and equipment, kids threw themselves into the game.
        Bob Charlie was taken to Whitehorse Baptist Residential School in the
        Yukon. He recalls that “you do your schoolwork during the day, do your
        chores like carrying wood or whatever. And you would play hockey for
        hours.”<br /><br />

        Indigenous hockey teams from reserves and residential schools were
        winning tournaments as far back as the 1920s. “When you hear about the
        history, the teams are really good. Like some of the best teams,” says
        Leon. “A lot of the guys are some of the best hockey players you never
        heard of.” Bob remembers: “The hockey teams here, the Peewee, the
        Juveniles, were so good that they were unbeatable for about two, three
        years in a row.”<br /><br />

        Photographs of children playing hockey were circulated to demonstrate
        the schools’ success at forcing Indigenous kids to accept colonial ways
        of life. Even today these photos are often misinterpreted as proof that
        the schools were supportive and enjoyable places to be. Photos and
        hockey tournaments were used as propaganda. Eugene says: “The
        missionaries used us. The missionaries liked to show off these kids from
        the residential school.”<br /><br />

        Skiing was a big part of the residential school experience in Inuvik,
        Northwest Territories. Lucy Kuptana was taken to Grollier Hall in
        Inuvik. “Everybody skied,” she recalls. “We went to territorial
        championships. Some went to national championships. Some went to Arctic
        Winter Games.” Lucy says: “By the time I left hostel I was racing the
        five-kilometre for championship races.”<br /><br />

        Despite her pride in her skiing accomplishments, Lucy says she “couldn’t
        imagine sending my kids out to ski at minus 40.” And for years, the
        children weren’t allowed to wear their own traditional outdoors
        clothing. “We were given the standard hostel parka,” she says. “I was
        around 10 when they started letting us use our own clothes, bring our
        own clothes from home.”<br /><br />

        When Lucy recently tried to take up skiing again with her sister, her
        sister replied: “Are you crazy? I never want to put on a pair of skis
        again!” Lucy says: “She was so good. She was so powerful. But the
        thought of skiing, she didn’t like that.”<br /><br />

        School administrators used the promise of sports programs to encourage
        parents to comply when Indian Agents, RCMP officers or school staff took
        their children away. Playing sports was also a valued privilege that
        could be taken away as punishment. At other times, students were forced
        to participate. “The skiing was pretty tough sometimes,” Lucy recalls.
        “We skied every night in the winter,” she says. “Even minus 40, we were
        out skiing. And you’re talking little kids. It was mandatory.”<br /><br />

        School staff used fear and threats to motivate child athletes. “We had
        to win,” says Eugene. “If you didn’t win, you didn’t get to go on other
        trips, you didn’t get fed as good. All of that reward system affected us
        psychologically.” He says, “I was so scared to lose. You know, you learn
        that as a kid, and it just grows on you.”<br /><br />

        Barbara remembers phys ed being used to separate her from her family.
        She says: “One of my older brothers came. He wanted to take me for the
        day.” But the school supervisor said: “No, she can’t go because she has
        to go to gym.” She remembers taking her anger out through floor hockey.
        “We were playing rough, and I took on the toughest girl,” she says. “I
        fought and I fought and that was the first time that I think that I ever
        fought anybody.” She laughs: “We’re still friends today.”<br /><br />

        Residential schools used sports to instill colonial ideas and ways of
        life into Indigenous children. As the 1996 report of the Royal
        Commission on Aboriginal Peoples says: “In school, in chapel, at work
        and even at play, the children were to learn the Canadian way.
        Recreation was re-creation.”<br /><br />

        But kids also used sports to develop solidarity and athletic skill
        during times of loneliness and neglect. Sports were a chance for
        children to work together and experience pride, even if they triumphed
        under the watchful eye of coaches and supervisors. As Lucy says: “these
        kids were excellent athletes. We were excellent athletes.”<br />

      <h3>
        Sports were a survival strategy. Indigenous kids were constantly finding
        ways to thrive and endure in a neglectful and racist environment.
        Sometimes that meant playing organized sports. Sometimes that meant
        making their own fun behind the backs of teachers and school staff. Tom
        says: “In order for us have fun, we used to break the rules, and that
        was the greatest thrill of all.”
